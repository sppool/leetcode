    "There is a robot starting at position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, \n",

    "The move sequence is represented by a string, and the character moves[i] represents its ith move. Valid moves are R (right),\n",

    "Output: true \n",
    "Explanation: The robot moves up once, and then down once. All moves have the same magnitude,\n",
    "so it ended up at the origin where it started. Therefore, we return true.\n",
